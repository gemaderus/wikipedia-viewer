#Wikipedia Viewer

This app searches in Wikipedia, showing ten results with a mini description, then you can read the full article at Wikipediaâ€™s page. Also, if you feel adventurous, you can choose a random article.

I have developed this app for Free Code Camp, to get the certification for intermediate level frontend developer.
